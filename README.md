TinDog: Unleash fun for dogs and their owners. Find playmates for your furry friend. A playful project crafted with CSS, Bootstrap, and HTML.
This repository contains the source code for TinDog, a responsive webpage I designed for fun. The goal is to help dog owners connect with other dog owners and find potential matches for their dogs. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front-end design, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing experience across different devices. Who knows, I might turn it into an an app sometime!
Here are some web design strategies I used:
Spacious & Sleek: Enjoy clean layouts and ample white space for a polished and modern feel.
Friendly Fonts: Experience stylish fonts that add a touch of warmth and personality.
Responsive Magic: Seamlessly adapt to any device for a flawless browsing experience.
Vibrant Palette: Delight in a vibrant color scheme that energizes the interface.
