# tindog
This repository contains the source code for TinDog, a responsive webpage I designed for fun during my bootcamp training. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front-end design, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing experience across different devices. 
Here are some web design strategies I used:
Spacious & Sleek: clean layouts and ample white space for a polished and modern feel.
Friendly Fonts:  stylish fonts that add a touch of warmth and personality.
Responsiveness: Seamlessly adapt to any device.
Vibrant Palette: Delight in a vibrant color scheme that energizes the interface.
